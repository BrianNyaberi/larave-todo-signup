# Laravel: To do App with Login and Registration (Authentication and Authorization)

## Description
This codebase touches all the CRUD operations needed in laravel. Create the auth pages (login and registers) with their controllers. Users can then register and start adding items to their list. Users are only authorized to view what belongs to them. If they try to view other users' items they will get an error.
